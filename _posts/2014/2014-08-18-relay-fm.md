[Myke and Stephen](http://relay.fm):

>Relay FM is our new home on the Internet, and where you can find all of our podcasts. The shows you have known and loved for years are being rebooted as part of the new network. Everything we have done so far in our podcasting careers has led us here, and we're pouring all of our love, knowledge and attention into this thing.

I've already listened to the [first episode of Analog(ue)](http://relay.fm/analogue/1) and [Inquisitive](http://relay.fm/inquisitive/1) and, as with everything Myke produces, they are fantastic. I wish him, Stephen and all the other hosts the best of luck.
