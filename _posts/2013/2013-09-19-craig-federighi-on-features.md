Craig Federighi, speaking [to Business Week:](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-19/cook-ive-and-federighi-on-the-new-iphone-and-apples-once-and-future-strategy)

<blockquote class="feature">
	<p>New? New is easy. Right is hard.</p>
</blockquote>

This applies way outside the realms of just consumer electronics. If you're going to do something, make sure it works and make sure it works well. Don't do features just for the hell of it.
