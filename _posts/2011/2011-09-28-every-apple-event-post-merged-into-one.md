First step is to add an image of the invite: ![Screen Shot 2011 09 27 at 11 00](http://therobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011-09-Screen_Shot_2011-09-27_at_11.00.png) Next up, let's talk about what we _know_ based on this image: **It's going to be about the iPhone.** And lastly, drivel on for a few paragraphs about what it must mean that the date and time are correct on the invite and then somehow make that mean the new iPhone is definitely getting an 8mp camera, A5 chip and more RAM.
