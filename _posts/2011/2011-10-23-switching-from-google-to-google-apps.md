After reading [this article](http://smarterware.org/3628/host-your-domain-email-at-gmail-without-forwarding) by Gina Trapani, I decided to move changed my email address from a standard @gmail account to a Google Apps email. Seemed easy enough at first; change my email address then make the changes on various services, done. Not quite. I’m a little more integrated into Google than I first realised. 

Here is a run down of everything I had to migrate and how I went about doing it.

**Gmail**

This one was reasonably simple but took a lot of effort. Once I had created my new GApps account, I used Gmail’s built-in import feature to get all my email from my old account.

This took a good 12 hours or so for everything to transfer, and be warned: everything arrives as if it’s new, so you’ll have to mark it all as read and then archive. This also doesn’t save your labels but I wasn’t too bothered by this as Gmail’s search is excellent.

Next up was changing my email with all the services I use. I wrote a list of everything I could think of and started with those. Then I looked through email I had received recently to spot any I might have missed. Here is the list of everything I had to change:

  * Ebay
  * Amazon
  * Facebook
  * iTunes
  * LinkedIn
  * GitHub
  * Twitter
  * Vimeo
  * Tumblr
  * Disqus
  * Wordpress
  * HSBC
  * Gravatar
  * Vealhost
  * Dropbox
  * McTime
  * Virgin Media
  * 123-reg
  * 1and1
  * ClickandBuy
  * Instapaper
  * Instagram
  * Paypal
  * Ifttt

There’s probably a few more that I’ve missed so I am checking my old email regularly just to make sure, but this is a good starting point for anyone looking to switch to GApps.

**Google Calendar**

Easy: Go into calendar settings and export each calendar and then import into my new GApps account. A wrote about this a [few days ago](http://therobb.com/2011-10-moving-from-google-calendar-to-icloud-syncing/).

**Google Reader**

Again, very simple. Just go into settings and export your subscriptions, then import into the new account.

**Google Docs**

I don’t use Google Docs a whole lot so I didn’t have anything to migrate. But Lifehacker have a [walkthrough for exactly this](http://lifehacker.com/5602545/how-to-migrate-your-entire-google-account-to-a-new-one).

**YouTube**

This one was a problem and I still don’t know what I want to do with this. There is no way for me to migrate my username to a new account so as it stands, I’m keeping this as a separate account. I don’t have any videos on there but I don’t want to give up my username.

**Google Analytics**

Again, really easy to migrate. Log in and select User Manager. Now add your new account as an admin, and you’re set.

And that pretty much covers everything. If there’s something I’ve neglected to mention, let me know in the comments and I’ll add it in.
