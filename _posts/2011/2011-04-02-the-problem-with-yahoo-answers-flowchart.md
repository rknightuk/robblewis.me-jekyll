We all know it. Yahoo Answers sucks 99.9% of the time. It's full of questions like "_How do I start a blog with Wordpress?_" or "_my computerz brokn and I cnt fix it. HELP!!!1_". The former being a question that could be easily answered by [Googling it](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=How+do+I+start+a+blog+with+Wordpress) and the latter, lets be honest, is never going to get answered. So I came up with this handy flowchart/sad look at state of Yahoo Answers:

So there you go. Next time you see someone about to ask a question on Yahoo Answers, show them this first. Then watch them ignore it anyway.
