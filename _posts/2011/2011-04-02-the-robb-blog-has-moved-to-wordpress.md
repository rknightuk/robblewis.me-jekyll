I have finally got round to moving my Tumblr blog over to a hosted Wordpress install. I did this for a number of reasons: 

  1. Tumblr's servers go down more than a lesbian porn star
  2. I was having all sorts of problems with my custom theme, despite the valid HTML and CSS
  3. Wordpress' plugin directory is huge
  4. I have a server, why not use it?
There are other reasons but I will outline these in an upcoming blog post (possibly using reason 1, above, as the title). If you subscribe via RSS, you don't need to do anything, Feedburner will sort all that out for you. If you used to follow me on Tumblr, you can subscribe to the RSS feed [here](rss). Farewell, Tumblr. It was fun while it lasted.
