Invisible Hand is a Chrome extension that automatically shows you the best price for items you're looking at. Just install the extension and forget about it.  Then when you're browsing Amazon, for example, Invisible Hand will search for prices and, if it finds a better price, this will be shown in a yellow bar at the top of the page: ![Invisiblehand](http://therobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011-10-invisiblehand.jpg)
