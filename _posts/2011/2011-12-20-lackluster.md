[Ben Brooks on The Verge:](http://brooksreview.net/2011-12-failure/)

> ...I was pretty excited about The Verge and what the crew behind it was trying to do. I think they created a great independent site that gets excellent access to companies they cover. I think that they created a great brand and image. But I think the siteâ€™s content is pretty lackluster.

I stopped reading it after a week.
