Based on posts from [Patrick Rhone](http://minimalmac.com/post/20014789917/calendar-redux-the-brooks-review?7ace8cd0) and [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2010-03-28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view), [Today](http://www.todaycalendarapp.com) is a calendar app with a distinct difference: it only shows you upcoming days and evernts. Not yesterday, not last week, not last month. In fact, the app has no function to be able to see the past at all.

And this is what makes it perfect. As Marco puts it:

> I don’t care about present-and-future items with equal granularity

Or even more bluntly:

> I don’t care about the past.

Today shows you everything you have coming up over the next few weeks and tapping on a day will show an expanded view of that day. Today also has the ability to add new events. I would like to be able to set how far into the future I can see events but this is my only gripe.

Although there are times I do need to see an actual calendar, Today has replaced the stock calendar app on my home screen. I was excited for this app to be released and my expections were exactly right. I love it.

Today is available for 69p [in the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/today-calendar/id547817413?mt=8).
