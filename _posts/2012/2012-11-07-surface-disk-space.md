[From the Surface FAQ](http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/surface-with-windows-RT/files-folders-and-online-storage/surface-disk-space-faq): 

>   * The 32 GB version has approximately 16 GB free hard disk space
>   * The 64 GB version has approximately 45 GB free hard disk space

So I guess we can stop comparing price against the 32gb iPad now.
