[Christine Chan:](http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012-11-quickadvice-nokiaheremaps)

> I was genuinely excited when I heard that the Nokia maps app was approved, because hey, that could mean Google Maps has a chance. However, what I unearthed in my short time with the app is something that I could barely use.

And that's in the opening paragraph. As Christine says though, this does give hope to those worrying that Google Maps won't get approved. On the plus side "Searching for POIs is actually pretty decent". Nice try Nokia. Close, but no cigar.
