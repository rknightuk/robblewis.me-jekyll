After pressing 1 for "Pay Monthly Options": 

> T-Mobile: "If you'd like to upgrade, leave T-Mobile, add a new line or gives us your PAC code, press 2"" Me: *Presses 2* T-Mobile: "You can see the full range of our phones or see if your elegible for an upgrade by going to T-Mobile.co.uk and signing up or logging in to My T-Mobile. Thanks for calling. Goodbye" 

To actually get through to cancellations, I had to go to a different department first just to get them to transfer me. So glad I am no longer a customer.
