> I don’t care what anyone says, fragmentation in the Android market is a very real problem, and it’s something that iPhone users haven’t had to worry about. Do you really want to be sitting around figuring out what games will or will not work on your iPhone? Or would you prefer to head to the App Store, check the compatibilitiy listing in the sidebar, and then install the game at your leisure? Obviously, I’m in the second camp. But what about you?

All the time this is still a problem, I won't even consider an Android device.
