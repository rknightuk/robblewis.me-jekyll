My friend Tara, over at Koozai, [deactivated Facebook for seven days:](http://www.koozai.com/blog/social-media/confessions-of-a-facebook-addict/)

> It was 8pm on a Sunday night. It could have been any old Sunday night. Nothing was new or out of the ordinary. As usual, I was scrolling through Facebook on my iPhone. For some reason, it struck me that I spend an excessive amount of time on Facebook, but I couldnâ€™t actually explain what I got out of it.

A great piece and well worth a read.
