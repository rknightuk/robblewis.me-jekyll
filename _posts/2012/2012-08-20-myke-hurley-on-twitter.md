Myke echoes my thoughts exactly [about the changes to Twitter](http://mykehurley.net/blog/on-twitter): 

> I don't want to use two services concurrently that ostensibly do the same thing and if everyone stays on both, then why would I switch? Maybe it will take a mass exodus of the people I follow to make me move and then maybe I just have to leave the stragglers behind.
