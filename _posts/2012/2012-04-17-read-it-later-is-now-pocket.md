So Read It Later [have rebranded themselves]()[ as "Pocket". New interface, cross platform and free. Great, so we can all quit Instapaper or Readability now, right? No. Just stop. Before everyone starts jumping ship from one service to another, [read this article by Brett Kelly](http://nerdgap.com/the-buyers-guide-for-minimalist-writing-apps/) on choosing a text editor. Now apply that same thought process to your read later service of choice. Do you like using Instapaper? Enjoy Readability's somewhat shady business practices? Fine. Just keep using it. Stop wasting your life trying out every imaginable service, webapp and text editor and just use what works for you.
