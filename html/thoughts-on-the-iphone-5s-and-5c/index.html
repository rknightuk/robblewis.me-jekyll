	<p>So Apple had their iPhone event. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/">iPhone 5S</a>. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/">iPhone 5C</a>. Nothing particularly surprising but interesting nonetheless.</p>

<h2>iPhone 5S</h2>

<p>The same solid design of the iPhone 5 with an improved camera, A7 chip and fingerprint scanner system called Touch ID. Touch ID is the feature I&#39;m most excited about. Not because I find inputting a pin code &quot;cumbersome&quot;, as Phil Schiller said, but because I don&#39;t have to enter my password for iTunes purchases. And <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/09/10/hands-on-with-the-iphone-5c-and-iphone-5s/">according to Jim Darymple</a>, it works well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I went through the process of adding my fingerprint to the 5S and then unlocking the phone using the fingerprint. It’s pretty seamless to do, just following the onscreen instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 5S comes in three colours, including the now-infamous &quot;gold&quot;. From what I&#39;ve seen of it, this isn&#39;t some flashy over-the-top monstrosity but a more subtle gold finish. I still won&#39;t be buying a gold one though.</p>

<p>The camera has a lot of improvements including video recording at 120fps, a new burst mode for capturing action shots and a dual LED flash to &quot;light your subject perfectly&quot;.</p>

<h2>iPhone 5C</h2>

<p>The 5C is more or less an iPhone 5, with a slightly bigger battery and plastic back. It comes in five colours and you can get a <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MF035/iphone-5c-case-blue">hideous case</a> for it, if you so choose. </p>

<p>The interesting part about this model is it&#39;s not &quot;cheap&quot; per se. Yes, it £80 cheaper than the 5S but that&#39;s still not what I would call cheap. But it&#39;s cheap enough that it&#39;ll likely be free on most contracts in the UK. </p>

<p>Taking a quick look around some carriers websites today, I can&#39;t seem to find a mention of the 5S, but the 5C is on all the home pages. It seems to me that this is the phone they&#39;re going to be trying to sell over the 5S for obvious reasons.</p>

<h2>iWork, iMovie and iPhoto</h2>

<p>From now on, when you buy a new iPhone or iPad, you&#39;re going to get the complete iOS iWork suite, as well as iMovie and iPhoto, for free. This is a great move by Apple and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the same deal was announced for iWork for Mac when Mavericks is released.</p>

<h2>Release dates</h2>

<p>Pre orders for the 5C and 5S <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk">open on Friday</a>. iOS7 will be released the the public on 18th September, two days before the new iPhones.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2013/">watch the announcement here</a>.</p>
