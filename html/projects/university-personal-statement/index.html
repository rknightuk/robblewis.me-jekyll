<p><em>Use as an example. Use it, edit it, copy it. Just be aware that most universities run <a href="http://turnitin.com/static/index.php">plagiarism checks</a> which could lead to you being rejected.</em></p>

<p>My passion for web design came in my first year of BTEC Networking, where I studied both ecommerce and website production, along with more networking-specific units. I have always been interested in web design and the internet in general ever since I acquired my first computer, but during these internet-based units my enthusiasm for the subject was amplified and I realised my ambition for a web based vocation. </p>

<p>Since completing these units, I have started my own web design company, Manor Design. Currently, I am working with three different clients on a range of products and services including website design, business cards and social media integration. This has encouraged me to look into, and put into practice, new technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3 as well as improve my skills with web-oriented tools including Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I have also improved my knowledge of building products to a specification as well as learning more about the social media environment and what affect this can have on businesses.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I closely follow developments in technology including web-based tools, mobile software and social media. Specifically, the growth of both the iOS, and Android platforms, and how this has directly affected the way in which companies address content delivery to mobile devices. I am an active user of Twitter and use the site to both consume and share news, and opinions, on technological advances. I find the site to be an excellent resource for current events, both locally and globally, due to the real-time nature of the site.</p>

<p>I also maintain two blogs; one technology-based, and one design-based. Both of these contain links to articles I find to be of interest, as well as my opinions on news in their respective subjects. This gives me an opportunity to think about how advances might affect the way users interact with internet services, the processes involved in creating these services, as well as receive feedback from others, through Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<p>Whilst studying, I work part time at McDonald&#39;s and I am currently working towards a promotion to Crew Trainer. During the time I have worked there, I have improved my skills for working within a team, time management and resolution of issues. Also, through McDonald&#39;s, I am studying for a level 2 NVQ in Hospitality, which is helping me develop my interpersonal skills further. </p>

<p>Between 2006 and 2009, before returning to education, I worked as an account manager for an electrical wholesaler. During this time, I was involved in large-scale projects such as Heathrow Terminal 5 and Queen Alexandra Hospital expansion. This experience gave me the skills to manage client requirements and specification, recommend solutions to problems as well as meeting strict deadlines and budgets. </p>

<p>On a web-based degree, I hope to cultivate both my skills, and my interest, in web design. Once I have completed university, I want to work for a web design firm, or managing a company&#39;s online assets. When I have gained suitable experience in the industry, I would like to become self-employed. I feel that this degree would help me reach my goal of a career as a professional web designer.</p>
