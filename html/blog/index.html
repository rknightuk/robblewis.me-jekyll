			<p><p>So Apple had their iPhone event. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/">iPhone 5S</a>. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/">iPhone 5C</a>. Nothing particularly surprising but interesting nonetheless.</p>

<h2>iPhone 5S</h2>

<p>The same solid design of the iPhone 5 with an improved camera, A7 chip and fingerprint scanner system called Touch ID. Touch ID is the feature I&#39;m most excited about. Not because I find inputting a pin code &quot;cumbersome&quot;, as Phil Schiller said, but because I don&#39;t have to enter my password for iTunes purchases. And <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/09/10/hands-on-with-the-iphone-5c-and-iphone-5s/">according to Jim Darymple</a>, it works well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I went through the process of adding my fingerprint to the 5S and then unlocking the phone using the fingerprint. It’s pretty seamless to do, just following the onscreen instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 5S comes in three colours, including the now-infamous &quot;gold&quot;. From what I&#39;ve seen of it, this isn&#39;t some flashy over-the-top monstrosity but a more subtle gold finish. I still won&#39;t be buying a gold one though.</p>

<p>The camera has a lot of improvements including video recording at 120fps, a new burst mode for capturing action shots and a dual LED flash to &quot;light your subject perfectly&quot;.</p>

<h2>iPhone 5C</h2>

<p>The 5C is more or less an iPhone 5, with a slightly bigger battery and plastic back. It comes in five colours and you can get a <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MF035/iphone-5c-case-blue">hideous case</a> for it, if you so choose. </p>

<p>The interesting part about this model is it&#39;s not &quot;cheap&quot; per se. Yes, it £80 cheaper than the 5S but that&#39;s still not what I would call cheap. But it&#39;s cheap enough that it&#39;ll likely be free on most contracts in the UK. </p>

<p>Taking a quick look around some carriers websites today, I can&#39;t seem to find a mention of the 5S, but the 5C is on all the home pages. It seems to me that this is the phone they&#39;re going to be trying to sell over the 5S for obvious reasons.</p>

<h2>iWork, iMovie and iPhoto</h2>

<p>From now on, when you buy a new iPhone or iPad, you&#39;re going to get the complete iOS iWork suite, as well as iMovie and iPhoto, for free. This is a great move by Apple and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the same deal was announced for iWork for Mac when Mavericks is released.</p>

<h2>Release dates</h2>

<p>Pre orders for the 5C and 5S <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk">open on Friday</a>. iOS7 will be released the the public on 18th September, two days before the new iPhones.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2013/">watch the announcement here</a>.</p>

		<p class="meta">Saturday 10 August, 2013</p>
		<p><p>Instapaper, having been <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013-04-25/instapaper-next-generation">sold to Betaworks</a> in April, has a <a href="http://beta.instapaper.com">shiny new beta</a> for the web interface which is long overdue. Not that the site wasn’t usable, but it was starting to feel very dated when compared to the likes of <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>. Despite this I had stuck with Instapaper as it had the one thing Pocket still doesn’t have: a way for me to pay them for the service, but that’s a topic for another day.</p>

		<p class="meta">Thursday 08 August, 2013</p>
		<p><p>I download a lot of TV shows (all legal of course) and have been renaming the files using <a href="https://github.com/tvrenamer/tvrenamer">TVRenamer</a>. After using TVRenamer manually for months I got fed up with having to do it, or the much more likely scenario happened where I would just leave them to build up in my downloads folder. I recently started using <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> to automatically rename and organise my photos. This works well because Hazel simply changes the filename to the date they were taken. TV shows are a little more complex than that as they have season and episode numbers as well as titles. Enter <a href="https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer">TVNamer</a>.</p>

		<p><p>Spotted this tip on Twitter (I can&#39;t remember/find who tweeted it, sorry!) and it blew my mind. When resizing a window in OS X, hold down alt. The window will stay centered on the screen. Amazing.</p>
