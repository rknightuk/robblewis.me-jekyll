##Overview

In this presentation, I will go over a few different topics related web technologies. Due to the nature of the web, I couldn’t begin to cover everything that could be defined as a web technology. Instead, I will discuss elements that I beleive are the most important and those which will give the best overview of the topic.

##What?

Firstly, what is a web technology? This definition from blurtit.com defines it as:

>“Web technology is the development of the mechanism that allows two or more computer devices to communicate over a network.” 

But that’s not a particularly elegant explanation. This is my definition for the purposes of this talk:

>“Any programming language, piece of hardware or software that allows applications to be built for use on the web”

##Invention

On Christmas day in 1990, Tim Berners-Lee successfully retrieved a file on a server to his computer, using the HTTP protocol. The HTTP protocol had only one function and that was to get, or request, an HTML page from a server. This was expanded in the years preceding 1995 to include other functions and became the set of protocols we still use today. The HTML page he retrieved used a series of tags first published by Tim Berners Lee in a paper aptly titled "HTML Tags”. In March 1993, the first web browser was introduced and it was called Mosaic.

##Technologies

Over the past 20 years since mosaic was released, the amount of technologies used to create and deploy websites has increased dramatically and browsers have had to adapt to support these. 

In late 1994, cookies were introduced which allows sites to keep a user logged in, offer tailored advertising and generally remember information about a specific user.

At the beginning of 1995 SSL was standardised making data secure between a client and a server, and was primarily used for e-commerce sites.

In the following two years, Flash, Java and Javascript were all introduced and in 1998 the 4th version of HTML and CSS version 2 were finalised. Although it was version 2 of CSS, the first version was never widely used or supported so this is generally seen as the “real” first version. 

##Browsers

Obviously all these techonologies would be useless without a browser to view the websites.  Netscape was released in 1994 and a year later Opera and Internet Explorer. It took another 8 years before Safari was released, commonly seen as the first of the “modern” browsers. Shortly after that, Firefox and then in 2008 Chrome was released. These three, and sometimes Opera, are considered to be “modern” broswers both in terms of their release date, but more so in terms of the technologies they support.

##Wordpress

The technologies mentioned are used in some way on every website in the world. As an example, lets take Wordpress, which is used on over 72 million sites. The standard installation uses a number of technologies including HTML and CSS, javascript, PHP and mySQL. And there are over 23,00 plugins for the system, used to expand the system to support other technologies or add functionality, all of which are written in PHP. 

##Apple site 1997/2012

To see how websites and technologies have evolved, lets take a look at Apple’s website...from 1997. The entire site is built using only HTML and inline styling. Nothing else. Now compare it to today. The landing page alone uses a combination of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and PHP. Videos can be played (with a compatible browser) without the need for a plugin such as flash and images move dynamically depending on where you are on the page through the use of CSS3 animations.

##Issues with Web Projects

So how do these new technologies and building websites cause issues with traditional project management techniques? As an example imagine you’re a builder. You can easily estimate  how long it would take to lay four rows of bricks for a garden wall, in this example, 1 hour. What about a painter painting four walls of an average size bedroom? Lets say two hours. But what about four lines of code? 10 minutes? An hour? Two hours? It totally depends. 

If you’re talking about a simple html page, maybe a couple of minutes. CSS? Probably the same. But what about a function to calculate the location of a website visitor and then serve them content based on that? 

##The future

The web has evolved at a staggering pace in the last five years and, I beleive it will continue at a similar pace for the next five. Consider that using tables for layout was considered okay once and now if you’re not using CSS for layout, you’d get laughed at. Flash has, for many years, been considered the standard for online video, audio and slideshows. With the introduction of HTML5, all of this can be accomplished without it. 

How do I think web technolgoies will evolve in the future? Obvisouly they’re already being used on smartphones and in the past year or so TV to allow for web browsing, on-demand content and more from the confort of your lounge. But the potential is endless: I beleive we will see more and more web enabled devices such watches, home appliances and  coffee tables. 

Thanks you. Any questions?
