## What is JDM?

JustDelete.Me is a directory of urls to delete your account from web services. Services are marked either easy, medium or hard depending on how difficult it is to delete that account. Those marked as hard have additional information on how to completely remove your account, such as Skype which requires you to contact customer services to do so.

But lets be honest, it's just a list of links with some styling.

## The launch

We launched just delete me with 16 services which I more or less picked at random the day before launch. On In the morning on the 19th of august I posted a blog post about the site and the site ended up getting around 2400 visitors on the first day which was fairly impressive considering myself and Ed thought we would a couple of hundred.

Traffic dropped over the next couple of days and by the thursday we only got around 800 visitors. Then Wired featured the site and the next day we got over 60,000 visitors.

## Featured in

Once wired had written their story, all of these sites and more wrote up their version of events. And by "wrote up" I basically mean copied and pasted what Wired wrote. By the time the fifth or sixth article had been written, none of the quotes from the site or my blog post were correct and it was obvious that none of them had actually visited the site as we had changed the design about five days into the site being launched. 

I also got interviewed for the Wall Street Journal and managed to look like a criminal in the process.

Then on the 28th of August, 10 days after we'd launched we hit one million pageviews.

## Number one

The next week the got to number one on Hacker News, Pinboard popular links and the repo was trending on GitHub. I also noticed that I was the number one PHP developer on GitHub which was odd seeing as these 8 lines were the only lines on PHP on the site at the time. 

And I didn't even write it.

## The server

Up until being on the front page of Hacker News, the server had been holding up fairly well. Then someone told me the site wouldn't load and it turned out we had around 800 visitors online. After some lengthy discussions on Skype we converted the site to static and moved the site to Media Temple. Which brings me on to why the server couldn't handle it.

I was on some really cheap hosting which was costing me $1.50 a month because all I was using it for was a couple of rarely-visited sites, namely my blog. This was a stupid move to launch a new service on cheap hosting but I honestly didn't think it would be as popular as it was. Which brings me nicely onto things I've learnt from this.

## Lessons learnt

Don't cheap out on hosting. Seems obvious but I just didn't consider it before launch. 

Journalists will just repost anything they find without any kind of research or even visiting the site itself. So many of the stories have old data or incorrect screenshots that they stole from someone else because they couldn't take the 5 seconds the make their own screenshot.

This was what I found most interesting about the whole thing. The general public don't understand how to use the internet. I got so many emails from people with stuff like this:

>I clicked the link to delete my account and it asks me to login. Why do I have to sign up to something to delete my account? Doesn't that defeat the point?

>Why would I sign up to justdelete.me to delete other accounts? That's just stupid.

And then there's the submission form which has a field for an email address, if you are required to send an email to cancel your account with a specific service. Of the 1000 submissions, around 50% of them have been submitted with people's personal email address in the hopes that I will delete their account for them and a few of them even have passwords for Facebook and Twitter accounts.

Had I put an email form on the site, I could potentially collected thousands of email addresses and done what I wanted with them. I was genuinely shocked that people just give out information this easily.
