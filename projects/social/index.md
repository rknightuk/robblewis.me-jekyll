title: My Social Media Rules
---

1. If you’re into cars, ponies or computer games, great. And if you follow me because you like what I tweet, even better. But I won’t follow you _just_ because you follow me. Don’t take it personally.
2. If you post a comment saying “Wow. Microsofts new product line up sucks” but don’t tweet a link to an article, how can I converse with you about the aforementioned story? I don’t want you to post a link with everything, but every now and again would be good. 
3. Don’t offer to get me more followers. That’s not how this works. People will follow me if my content appeals to them. Go home.
4. Basically any mention of football and I will unfollow you. Except during the World Cup. Then I’ll let you off.
5. #blatent #overuse of #hashtags. Don't do it.

Other than that, [follow me](http://twitter.com/rmlewisuk), say hello and lets be Twitter BFFs.
