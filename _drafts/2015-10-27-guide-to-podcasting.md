This is by no means a complete or authoratitive guide but more an overview of how [John](http://twitter.com/johnvoorhees) and I setup [our podcast](http://ruminatepodcast.com). My hope is that this might help someone else setup their own podcast.

When we discussing starting Ruminate, we had two requirements:

1. Managing the podcast needs to be as simple as possible.
2. It needs to sound good.

Having discussed a few options with [Myke Hurley](http://twitter.com/imyke) we came to conclusion that [Simplecast](https://simplecast.fm/) would be the best option. They host the website, manage the rss feed, offer good statistics, and have reasonable pricing.

- Simplecast
- Domain
- Twitter
- iTunes submission

John already had Samson Meteor and I bought a Blue Yeti (the lovely black one) which may not be the best microphones in the world, are pretty damn good. Since episode 6, both of us have been using desk arms to avoid background noise from keyboards and other desk-related things. Check out [Marco Arment's microphone review](http://www.marco.org/podcasting-microphones) for more information on other available microphones.
