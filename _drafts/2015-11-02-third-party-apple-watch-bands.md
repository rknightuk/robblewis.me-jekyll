excerpt: "A review of some third-party replicas of Apple's wacth bands"

When I first saw the [Hermès Cuff for Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/09/09Apple-and-Herm-s-Unveil-the-Apple-Watch-Herm-s-Collection.html) I thought it looked like a great wacth band but also knew that there was no way I was going to pay upwards of a thousand pounds for one. So I kept an eye on eBay, looking for third party manufacturers making similar bands. These became available for purchase about a month after the announcement so I decided to order one. The seller also had some other copies of Apples bands and I ordered a blue sport band, and a black Milanese loop as well as a pair of black adaptors to better match my space grey sport watch.

### Leather Cuff (£20)

I haven't seen the Hermès band in real life so I can only compare against photos but this band is more or less identical in design to the Hermès version. But as you might imagine, it feels cheap. The leather is pretty thin, not particularly soft, and it's generally uncomfortable to wear. The buckle feels like a toy from a Christmas cracker. There are some third party version that are around the £100 mark that would likely not have these issues but something I did notice whilst wearing the band, is that because of the way the band is designed my Apple Watch sits significantly higher on my wrist then when I using a sport band. I found this to be annoying and it's possible that the Hermès version has the same problem.

### Blue Sport Band (£5)

After trying the leather cuff and seeing how cheap it felt, I was surprised to find that the sport band from the same seller felt pretty good. The design is identical in every way to the offical version and feels more or less the same when wearing it. The only noticeable difference between this one and the Apple version is that Apple's feels thicker and sturdier.

### Black Milanese (£20)

Apple only makes the Milanese loop milanese loop in one colour, so for someone like me with the space grey watch, my only option for a milanese loop is third party.
