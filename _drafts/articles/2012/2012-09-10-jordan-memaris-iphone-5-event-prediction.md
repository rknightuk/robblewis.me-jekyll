My friend Jordon Memari [makes a hell of a prediction](http://www.jordanmemari.com/2012/apple-iphone-5-event-september-2012/) for Wednesday's Apple event: 

> I am really starting to think it is a thermometer. If it is flipped, the red (hot) is at the top and the blue (cold) is at the bottom. There is also a green bar with a white border running up the side and what appears to be numbers on the bottom.

If he's right, this would be pretty cool but about as useful as the separate compass app. Or contacts. Or stocks.
