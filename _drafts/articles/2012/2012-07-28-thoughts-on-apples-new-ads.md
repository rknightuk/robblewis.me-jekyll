Apple have [released three new Mac ads](http://www.apple.com/mac/videos/) featuring a genius in various scenarios fixing people’s Mac-related problems.

The [general consensus](http://one37.net/blog/2012/7/28/apples-new-mac-ads-are-embarrassing.html) seems to be that they are embarrassing and cringe worthy. I really don’t agree, and I’m [not the only one](https://twitter.com/imyke/statuses/229113757945708544). I think they’re smart and a great way to highlight the advantages of what Apple can offer.
