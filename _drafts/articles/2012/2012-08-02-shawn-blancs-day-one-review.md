[Shawn Blanc, on Day One](http://shawnblanc.net/2012-08-day-one-review/): 

> Over the years, most of the major, monumental milestones of life were documented in my Moleskine. But not all. And that’s why I’m glad to have an app that let’s me easily and joyfully add a snapshot or a quick note about an important or memorable event. These are the things my family and I will look back on 20 and 30 years from now with great fondness.

I may have to give it another try after reading this review.
