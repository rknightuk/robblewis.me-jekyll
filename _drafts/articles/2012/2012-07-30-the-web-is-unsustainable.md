> Ever had trouble finding a domain name? Already taken? Used? Squatted? Really expensive? Yeah, you are not alone. What people don’t think about is that the first domain name was Symbolics.com bought in 1985, only 27 years ago. Think about that for a while… the Internet including of course the World Wide Web and – more importantly for this discussion – Domain Name Systems is one of the most important inventions of all time, yet we are having trouble coming up with names for new websites just 27 years later. The web is unsustainable in its current form.

I don't entirely agree that the web "unsustainable" in it's current form, but after only 27 years, this is worrying and something that definitely needs to be addressed.
