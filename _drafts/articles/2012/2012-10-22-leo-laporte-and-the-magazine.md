I heard on Twitter that apparently Leo Laporte was “trashing” Marco Arment and [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org) on [TWiT](http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech/376), so I thought I’d take a look. First off, this gem:

> “He decided to take articles from his blog, and others, and make something called The Magazine”.

Obviously Leo has done no research into what The Magazine is. None of the articles are on anyone’s blog at the time of publishing. Credit to [Dwight Silverman](http://twitter.com/dsilverman) for actually having some of his facts straight. Then Leo said this:

> “He’s making 14k a month, probably, for very little work”

This sounds like Leo is pissed that he didn’t think of it first. And then there was this from one of the guests (I couldn’t work out which one):

> “Nobody listens to 5by5”

Right.
