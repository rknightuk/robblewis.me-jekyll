The two most recent episodes of [Enough](http://www.70decibels.com/enough/) are by far the best episodes of any podcasts I've ever listened to. ((Although Brett reading my review of Cooking With in a British was pretty awesome)) Have a listen: [Episode 115: The Wizard Behind The Curtain](http://www.70decibels.com/enough/2012/3/1/ep-115-the-wizard-behind-the-curtain.html) [Episode 116: TV is Broken](http://www.70decibels.com/enough/2012/3/6/ep-116-tv-is-broken.html)
