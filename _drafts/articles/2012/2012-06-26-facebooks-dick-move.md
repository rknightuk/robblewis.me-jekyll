Facebook just made a change to everyone's settings without telling anyone. Everyone's profile now display's their @facebook.com email by default and hides any others they may have listed. Read the article [over on Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5921095/facebook-just-changed-your-email-without-permission-heres-how-to-get-it-back) to see how to change it back. You dicks, Facebook. Seriously, you suck.
