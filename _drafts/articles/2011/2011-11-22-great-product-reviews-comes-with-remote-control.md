I'm hunting around on the internet for products both for myself as well as for christmas presents. As always, I'm reading all the reviews, specifically the low rated ones, to get a good idea of the quality of various products. And then I see this review:

> She absolultly [sic] loves it. Comes with remote control.

This is _not_ a legitimate review. Lets break it down:

> She absolultly loves it.

Firstly, a small amount of spell-checking wouldn't go a miss. Secondly, who is "she"? No context what so ever. Your grandma? Your daughter? Your wife? Your pet iguana? FFS. Next up is this gem: 

> Comes with remote control.

Yep. I read that in the description too. That is the entirety of the review. How is this in the slightest bit helpful? Next time you think about writing a product review, how about you write all your gems of wisdom on toilet roll and, well, y'know. Rant over.
