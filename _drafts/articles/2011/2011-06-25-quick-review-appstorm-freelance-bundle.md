![The AppStorm Freelance Mac App Bundle is on Sale | Mac AppStorm](http://therobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011-06-The-AppStorm-Freelance-Mac-App-Bundle-is-on-Sale-Mac.AppStorm.jpg)

A few days before the AppStorm Freelance bundle was released I had made the decision that I wanted both 1Password and TextExpander, but that I would wait until at least one of them was in a bundle. So when I saw the AppStorm bundle I had to get it.

For $50 (around Â£30) you get:

  * 1Password
  * Billings
  * TextExpander
  * LittleSnapper
  * WriteRoom
  * Radium
  * Arq
  * Alarms

Of those apps, I will definitely use 5, which seems like a pretty good deal to me. I have yet to fully understand TextExpander so if anyone knows of a good article explaining it for a novice, drop me a link [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/rmlewisuk) or leave a comment below.
