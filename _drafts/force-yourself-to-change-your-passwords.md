excerpt: "How I forced myself into changing all my passwords."

[Heartbleed is pretty bad](http://heartbleed.com/) and we should all change our passwords for everything. But it's much easier to just leave them as they are and hope nothing bad happens. So how did I force myself to change my passwords? Delete all my saved passwords and cookies in Google Chrome.

To delete all saved passwords in Chrome, go to "Clear Browsing History" and check the passwords and cookies boxes. Now, buy [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) or something similar. From now on, whenever you go to a site where you have an account, you (hopefully) won't know your password so select the "forgot your password" link, generate a secure password with 1Password and change it.

I also signed up to a couple of accounts over the weekend and made sure that the I generated passwords rather than just using an easy-to-remember one. This was a little more difficult as I have a default password I tend to use on new accounts and out of habit, I nearly used it anyway.

If I'd still had all my passwords in Google Chrome, I probably wouldn't have changed them. I deleted my saved passwords on Friday night and I have now upgraded most, if not all, of my accounts to have new, securer passwords.

And if you still can't be bothered to change your passwords, at a minimum you should [2-factor all the things](http://twofactorauth.org/).
